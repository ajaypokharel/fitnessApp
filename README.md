# Fitness App
React Native App to create and track workouts (wip)
Since React Native supports both iOS and Android, this app should run on both platforms. To run:
- `git clone https://github.com/ajaypokharel/fitnessApp`
- `npm install`
- `expo start`

You should see an emulator (or app open if device connected)
